# Advent of Code (2020)

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles created by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/) for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language. They are used as speed contests, interview prep questions, company training excercises, university coursework, general practice problems, or as individual or group challenges.

This repository contains my solutions, in JavaScript, to each of the day's problems. 

# Advent of Christ (Year Unknown)

**Did you know?** Though the term `Advent` is generally used to reference the time at the end of the [Gregorian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar) year in anticipation of Christmas, the orignal meaning had very little to do with the birth of [the Christ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ_(title)).

Roman Christians until the 6th century used the term in reference to the prophesied [Second Coming](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Second-Coming) of Jesus, until it became linked to first coming of Jesus at Christmas in the Middle Ages.
